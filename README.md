# Friendship-calculator
Love calculator is an android application which calculates the love percentage from the names of the partners. I made this application using android studio in Java language.

## Working
1. It takes the name of a person from the user.
2. It takes the name of another person from the user.
3. And when the user clicks on the calculate button the algorithm generates a result.
4. The result is calculated by comparing both the names and then it deletes the words which are same in both the names.
5. The remaining words in each name are multiplied by 10 and then the result is shown.

## Apk
The apk of this application can be found in the apk folder in the repositries.
